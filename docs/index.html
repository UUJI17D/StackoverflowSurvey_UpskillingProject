  <h1>How AI Changed the Stack Overflow Community: A Data Story (2017–2025)</h1>
  <p>What 9 years of developer surveys reveal about the rise of AI in coding</p>
</header>
<main>

<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The world of software development is changing fast. In the last decade, artificial intelligence (AI) has gone from a futuristic buzzword to a daily tool for millions of developers. But how has this shift actually played out in the real world? What do developers really think about AI, and what are they using it for?</p>
  <p>To answer these questions, I analyzed Stack Overflow’s annual developer surveys from 2017 to 2025. These surveys capture the voices of tens of thousands of developers worldwide, asking about their habits, opinions, and the technologies shaping their work.</p>
  <p>In this post, I’ll walk you through what the data says about the rise of AI in the developer community—how it’s become a central topic, how people feel about it, and what they’re actually doing with it.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Part I: How Did AI Become a Central Topic?</h2>
  <p>In the early years, AI was barely mentioned in the Stack Overflow survey. But starting in 2023, something changed: AI exploded onto the scene. By 2025, about <b>one in five survey questions</b> was about AI.</p>
  <figure>
    <object class="svg" type="image/svg+xml" data="svgs/AIRelatedQuestions.svg"></object>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 1:</b> The number of AI‑related questions in the Stack Overflow survey grew rapidly after 2023.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>This shift reflects how quickly AI tools—like code assistants and chatbots—have become part of everyday programming. The survey itself is a mirror of what matters most to developers, and AI is now front and center.</p>
  <figure>
    <object class="svg" type="image/svg+xml" data="svgs/Number_of_surveys.svg"></object>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 2:</b> While the total number of survey questions dipped during the pandemic, the share focused on AI kept rising.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h2>Part II: How Do Developers Use and Feel About AI?</h2>

  <h3>How often do developers use AI?</h3>
  <p>By 2025, more than half of developers surveyed said they use AI tools. And among those, <b>daily use</b> is the most common pattern.</p>
  <figure>
    <object class="svg" type="image/svg+xml" data="svgs/Usage2.svg"></object>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 3:</b> Most developers who use AI do so every day.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3>How do developers feel about AI?</h3>
  <p>The majority of developers are still <b>favorable</b> toward using AI in their workflow. But the initial excitement is cooling. In 2025, fewer people are “very favorable,” and more are “unfavorable” compared to previous years. It seems that as AI becomes more common, people are starting to see both its strengths and its limits.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <object class="svg" type="image/svg+xml" data="svgs/Favorable.svg"></object>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 4:</b> Most developers are positive about AI, but the share of “very unfavorable” responses is rising.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h3>Do developers trust AI?</h3>
  <p>
    Trust in AI tools is <b>mixed</b>. Many developers say they “somewhat trust” AI, but the number who “highly distrust” AI has grown to over 13% in 2025. This suggests that while AI is useful, developers are learning to be cautious—especially as they see where AI can make mistakes.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <object class="svg" type="image/svg+xml" data="svgs/Accuracy.svg"></object>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 5:</b> Trust is still positive overall, but more people are skeptical than before.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Part III: What Do Developers Actually Use AI For?</h2>
   <p>
    So what are developers doing with AI? The most popular use is <b>writing code</b>. Many also use AI to <b>search for answers</b> and help with debugging. But when it comes to tasks that require more oversight—like code review, deployment, or project planning—developers are more cautious.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <object class="svg" type="image/svg+xml" data="svgs/Tools.svg"></object>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 6:</b> Writing code and searching for answers are the most common uses for AI. Fewer developers use AI for code review, deployment, or planning.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Writing code</b> and <b>searching for answers</b> are the top uses.</li>
    <li>Fewer developers trust AI for <b>code review</b>, <b>deployment</b>, or <b>project planning</b>.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Part IV: What About Missing Answers?</h2>
  <p>Not every developer answered every question—especially the more complex ones about AI. In 2025, the overall “no answer” rate was high, but the AI questions analyzed here were actually answered more often than average.</p>
  <figure>
    <object class="svg" type="image/svg+xml" data="svgs/NoAnswer.svg"></object>
    <figcaption><b>Figure 7:</b> Participation in AI questions was relatively high, even as overall survey response rates dropped.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>AI has become a <b>central topic</b> in the developer community, both in conversation and in daily work.</li>
    <li>Most developers now use AI tools, often every day, but their attitudes are becoming more realistic and nuanced.</li>
    <li>Writing code and searching for answers are the main uses for AI, while more sensitive tasks are still handled with caution.</li>
    <li>Developers are learning to trust AI where it helps, but also to question its output and know its limits.</li>
  </ul>
